A CLI game based off of Donald Knuth's Mastermind

Work in progress...

Note to myself when refactoring...

- Create stronger validations in maker/breaker.rb

- Make sure user's input code can only be unique

- Make it so answer is hidden @breaker.rb

- DRY up sample methods in maker.rb (create it as it's own method)

- DRY up sample method, make it into an instance variable
